# Contributing to The Memory Pulse

**The Cortex is Evolving.**

We welcome contributions from those who wish to enhance the physiological monitoring of digital systems. Whether it is optimizing the heuristic engines, expanding the data matrix, or refining the visual interface, your input is valuable.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own quadrant.
2.  **Clone** the data stream:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/The-Memory-Pulse.git
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Create a branch** for your feature (e.g., `feature/neural-link-integration`).
5.  **Commit** your changes with clear, semantic messages.
6.  **Push** to your fork and submit a Pull Request.

## Coding Standards

-   **Python 3.8+** compatibility is required.
-   Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines.
-   Type hinting (`typing`) is mandatory for all new functions.
-   Ensure all new features are accompanied by tests.

## Roadmap Priorities

-   [ ] FPGA Hardware Interface
-   [ ] Neural Network Anomaly Detection
-   [ ] Cross-Platform "Pulse" Sharing
-   [ ] 3D Visualization of Memory Blocks

Join us in defining the heartbeat of the machine.
